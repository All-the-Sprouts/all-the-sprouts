                  Our <strong>Lexington</strong> branch was started in Summer of 2020, when the pandemic still had all the students locked down at home, stuck in new learning environments. To combat the educational drought, we formed Science Outdoors and Summer Science Seminars, which operated in-person and online respectively to teach students about science. In 2021, we grew to over 100 students combined, and in 2022, we added an art branch. In 2023, we merged to become the Lexington Branch of All the Sprouts you see today!
