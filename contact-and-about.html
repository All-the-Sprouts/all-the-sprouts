In Spring 2023, I placed as a semifinalist in the USA Biology Olympiad and earned a silver award in the British Biology Olympiad. I have also been a crucial part of my school's DOE (Department of Energy) National Science Bowl team for three years, reaching nationals and helping earn thousands of dollars in funding. Moreover, I have completed college-level engineering courses recognized by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Outside of STEM, I teach English to Chinese seniors as a part of LEXCSEA. In my downtime, I am often seen listening to music or podcasts and reading books. My goal is to spread knowledge to everyone, and I hope to transform my students into eager young minds.</p>

In the past two years, I've become a superfan of the world's lovely wooden photosynthesizers (aka TREES) while competing in Forestry in not one but two of LHS' most fantastic clubs: Science Olympiad and Envirothon (HIGHLY suggest joining one or both of the two!!). I've also delved into ecology both in school and in Envirothon, and I've thoroughly fallen in love with it. I guess I did something right because last year the LHS team became NCF Envirothon National Champions :)</p>

His disinterests include writing third-person biographies, writing third-person autobiographies, writing autobiographies, and geometry. In addition to being incompetent at writing and calculating, he is also mediocre at chemistry despite claiming chemistry to be his second subject. Despite all of this, he manages to attain a decent 16 ppg during Science Bowl games and has become the captain of the LHS Science Bowl team.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Hi, I am Nishtha Chhabra, a rising junior at Lexington High School and a teacher at Science Outdoors and Slice of Art. I done art since 7th grade. My strengths are acrylic painting, digital art, soft pastels, charcoal and sketching. I have been learning biology and chemistry since 6th grade. Both the subjects are really engaging and helpful in the real world, and I hope I can pass that thinking onto my upcoming students.</p>
